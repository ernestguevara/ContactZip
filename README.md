# SquadZip Coding Exam

This repository contains the code for the SquadZip Programming Exam.

## Technologies Used

- MVVM architecture pattern
- Room Persistence Library for offline data storage
- Clean Architecture principles for code organization and separation of concerns
- Dagger Hilt for dependency injection
- Retrofit for consuming JSON-REST API from https://reqres.in/
- Glide for image loading and manipulation
- Splash screen implementation
- Coroutines for asynchronous programming
- Navigation Components for app navigation

## Requirements

Use data from https://reqres.in/ for JSON-REST API and consume using Retrofit
- Persist contacts data offline using Room
- Use MVVM Pattern
- Show a list of contact persons
- Show a detail view of the contact after tapping a contact

Optional:
- Clean Architecture implementation is a plus
- Data Binding and Dependency Injection (Dagger Hilt) is a plus


## Specifications
1. Fetch contact data from the JSON-REST API provided by https://reqres.in/ using Retrofit.
2. Implement offline persistence of contact data using Room.
3. Follow the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern for separation of concerns.
4. Display a list of contact persons in the application.
5. Show a detailed view of a contact when a contact item is tapped.
6. Implement Clean Architecture principles to ensure modularity, testability, and maintainability of the codebase.
7. Implement Data Binding for efficient data binding between UI components and data models.
8. Utilize Dependency Injection with Dagger Hilt for managing and injecting dependencies.
9. Implement Unit Testing using the Test Driven Development (TDD) approach for Hilt, ViewModels, and Room.
10. Handle the scenario of empty data and display appropriate messages or UI components.
11. Implement pagination with end results validation for efficient loading and displaying of contact data.
12. Include swipe refresh functionality to allow users to manually refresh the contact list.
13. Ensure proper separation of users and contacts data to maintain data integrity and organization.
14. Integrate intents for email, SMS, and dialer functionalities to provide seamless communication options.
15. Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing contacts using Room.

## Message from the Developer

I hope you'll appreciate the design and functionality of the app. Please note that I used your company colors and logo as a reference for the app name and logo, I'll change that if needed. I truly admire your company's values and work environment, as discussed during our interviews. Thank you!
